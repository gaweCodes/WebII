    <h1>Tasks 1-5</h1>
    <h2>Task 1-5-1 - Guess the numbers</h2>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-1</h3>
    <p>
      Log a random number between 1 and 10.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-2</h3>
    <p>
      The user should now guess this number. A prompt dialog is displayed in
      which he can enter his number. If the entered number is correct - log
      congrats. If not show prompt again.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-3</h3>
    <p>
      If the user presses Cancel, stop the game!
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-4</h3>
    <p>
      If the user doesn't enter a valid number. Show a note in the console.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-5</h3>
    <p>
      The number tries should also be counted and logged to the console.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-6</h3>
    <p>
      Create a method '<code>showMessage</code>'. It logs the above texts to the
      onsole.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-7</h3>
    <p>
      If the entered value is wrong, you should display if the value is larger
      or smaller than the searched one.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1-5-1-8</h3>
    <p>
      The last step is to show the history of tries.
